In the above diagram:
* The dots · represent short signals.
* The dashes - represent long signals.

1. Button **A** is a short signal.
2. Button **B** is a long signal.
3. Begin by typing out a letter using the **A** and **B** buttons.
4. When you are done, press **A** and **B** at the same time. This will add the letter to the current string waiting to be sent.
5. To send the current string, type the *end* character by typing **ABAB**. This will send the string to all other microbits on the radio frequency.
